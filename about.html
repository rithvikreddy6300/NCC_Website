        The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is the youth wing of the Indian Armed
        Forces with its headquarters in New Delhi, India. It is open to school
        and college students on a voluntary basis as a Tri-Services
        Organisation, comprising the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, engaged
        in developing the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic
        citizens. The soldier youth foundation in India is a voluntary
        organization which recruits cadets from high schools, higher secondary,
        colleges and universities all over India. The cadets are given basic
        military training in small arms and drill. The officers and cadets have
        no liability for active military service once they complete their
        course. The emblem of the NCC consists of 3 colors; red, dark blue and
        light blue. These colors represent the Indian Army, Indian Navy and
        Indian Air Force respectively. The 17 lotuses indicate the 17
        directories of India.

    <h2>Aim of NCC</h2>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    <div class="info-card-content">
      <p>
        The ‘Aim’ of the NCC laid out in 1988 have stood the test of time and
        continue to meet the requirements expected of it in the current
        socio–economic scenario of the country. The NCC aims at developing
        character, comradeship, discipline, a secular outlook, the spirit of
        adventure and ideals of selfless service amongst young citizens.
        Further, it aims at creating a pool of organized, trained and motivated
        youth with leadership qualities in all walks of life, who will serve the
        Nation regardless of which career they choose. Needless to say, the NCC
        also provides an environment conducive to motivating young Indians to
        join the armed forces.

    <h2>Origin of NCC</h2>
    <div class="underline"></div>

        In the year 1948 a total of 96 units of Senior Division were raised,
        comprising variety of units to include one Armoured Corps, three
        Artillery, five Engineers, two Signals and two Medical – and 83
        companies of Infantry. As there was some delay in the establishment of
        NCC in UP, Madras and Bihar, whose Govts wanted every student joining
        NCC to be verified by police prior to enrolment, only 20,000 cadets had
        joined the NCC in the year 1948. The raising of the Junior Division
        units did not progress well owing to shortage of trained school
        teachers. The main difficulty was that adequate number of teachers of
        the desired quality did not come forward to work as NCC officers. There
        were various administrative reasons attributed to this. Sometimes,
        colleges and schools were not in a position to spare the teaching staff
        except during the summer vacation. Thus the NCC which has now13 lakh
        cadets on its rolls, had started with 20,000 cadets in 1948.
